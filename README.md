# FAQ

Q: How can I export .json files on cstimer.net

A: Click on export, then file, and the exported .json file should be in your download folder.

# For the developers!!!

I didn't upload any source code straight to the repository. If you need it, then simply download the version you need, and it will be there, as a python file.
