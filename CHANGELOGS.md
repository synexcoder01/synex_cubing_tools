## [v0.1_alpha 2024.10.15](https://github.com/synexcoder01/synex_cubing_tools/releases/tag/v0.1_alpha)
- I started the project.
- I added the main menu.
- I added the ability to start a new session, or continue an existing one.
- I added the ability to manage your sessions (delete, rename).

## [v0.2_alpha 2024.10.16](https://github.com/synexcoder01/synex_cubing_tools/releases/tag/v0.2_alpha)
- You can now see the available sessions, when you continuing a session.
- There is an are you sure question, when you are deleting a session.
- If you enter a time, it checks, if it is a workable data.
- Adding breaklines, to make the instructions more clear and nice.

## [v0.3_alpha 2024.10.17](https://github.com/synexcoder01/synex_cubing_tools/releases/tag/v0.3_alpha)
- The idea to import csv files, is replaced, with importing cstimer.net .json files. (Still WIP)
- I made it clear, that when you can type anything to do something, you can just press 'enter'. It is faster.
- If you are making a new session, it does not starts it immediately. You need to choose the 'continue session' option.
- If you create a session, it does not create a comment and P.1 segment in it because it was pointless.
- Making the code more clear, but that does not affects the user experience, only developers (in a good way).
