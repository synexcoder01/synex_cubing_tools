# synex Cubing Tools

## Who is this for?

For people, who like twisty puzzles, and want to have a basic tool, that runs locally on their system. Because you know, where the files are stored, you can backup the manually, or move to another place very easily.

## User manual

You need python installed on your computer to use this program!

Download the latest version from here, and install it on your system: https://www.python.org/

To download the software, click on the releases tab on the right, and download the latest release. [Or click here (v0.3)](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17412444/synex_cubing_tools_v0.3_alpha.zip)

- Start the program, by double-clicking the .py file.
- Follow the instructions, the program says.
- Make sure you have an external timer, that you can use to time your solves. A phone or any other device with a stopwatch will do the job. You can download timer apps for more precise timing.
- Make sure you write everything right, how it's written in the examples:
    - Make sure you use '.' as a decimal point, not ','.
    - Make sure you did not write letters or other symbols in the time.
    - Make sure you did not leave any empty fields.
    - Make sure you did not make any mistakes in the names of the sessions or the names of the solves.

## Changelogs

v0.1_alpha 2024.10.15
- I started the project.
- I added the main menu.
- I added the ability to start a new session, or continue an existing one.
- I added the ability to manage your sessions (delete, rename).

v0.2_alpha 2024.10.16
- You can now see the available sessions, when you continuing a session.
- There is an are you sure question, when you are deleting a session.
- If you enter a time, it checks, if it is a workable data.
- Adding breaklines, to make the instructions more clear and nice.

v0.3_alpha 2024.10.17
- The idea to import csv files, is replaced, with importing cstimer.net .json files. (Still WIP)
- I made it clear, that when you can type anything to do something, you can just press 'enter'. It is faster.
- If you are making a new session, it does not starts it immediately. You need to choose the 'continue session' option.
- If you create a session, it does not create a comment and P.1 segment in it because it was pointless.
- Making the code more clear, but that does not affects the user experience, only those, who rewrites, or use my code.

## FAQ

Q: How can I export .json files on cstimer.net

A: Click on export, then file, and the exported .json file should be in your download folder.

## For the developers!!!

I didn't upload any source code. If you need any source code, simply download the version you need, and it will be there, as a python file.
